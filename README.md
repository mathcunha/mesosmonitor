# Monitoring Apache Mesos Resources
The adoption of container based solutions is increasing dramatically among IT companies. Reports recently presented by Docker shows this adoption in terms of numbers (http://blog.docker.com/2015/01/docker-project-2014-a-whirlwind-year-in-review/).
But as more containers are being executed by a company, a new challenge arises, which is related to the monitoring of the containers and its computational resources. This situation leads us to the project Apache Mesos, with the help of Mesos it's possible to keep a track of the current status of the containers, the amount of computational resources available and the amount of computational resources actually in use.

Now the company have a fault tolerant datacenter managed by Mesos and a view of the current status of resource usage and containers, since Mesos does not keep a computational resource usage history. But, what if were possible to keep a track of resource usage during a time? If these informations were stored, it would be easy to understand the datacenter behavior when a Mesos node is not working, or a container is executed.
